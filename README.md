# Vision Statement

With the semesters coming, and going, it’s expected that there are a few things one would want to get rid of. Or things that someone would want to have in the long run. For students to sell unwanted items - such as furniture or textbooks, and buy or search for items that are needed, they would need a platform. There are other apps out there that do exactly this. However, it is far more expensive, untrusted, and remote. What they need is a platform that provides students with the increased opportunity to quickly and easily sell their unwanted items, search for items and communicate with local students to receive their items because they are physically closer (shorter distance to travel). When the natural barrier of distance is the only thing stopping you from making that tempting purchase, we have a solution. Our target audiences are students looking to brighten up and liven up their living space, room, desk, and many more. But specifically Calvin Students living in the dorm and KE apartment. Whether they are moving into (sophomore/junior), or out of KE (senior), or are living in the dorms (freshman), there are constant times where different items must be dealt with. These items can be both a necessity and a nuisance to obtain or get rid of. We hope to eliminate those trivial concerns and ease the transition into a happier, livelier time in your life.

Our app has three main features: 1) posting items that you are attempting to sell and 2) searching and 3) buying items that you are in need of. Both of these features are quite similar to each other, in which users will be able to post multiple pictures of their items, a title, a description, a price, and a text for contact information. Our team will build our app using React Native and we will use a database to store data about users’ posts of buying, selling, and requesting. Additional features would include an 1) organizational structure to indicate buying, selling, and requesting, a 2) search engine and 3) filters to quickly look up items for buying or requesting, a 4) login page for users to make an account, an 5) account where users can change their profile picture and add contact information, and connect with CIT to enable Calvin students’ to use their 6) Calvin email as an account.
